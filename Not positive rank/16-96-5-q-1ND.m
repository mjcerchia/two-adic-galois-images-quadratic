/****************************************************************************** 
Here is a summary of the argument.

Let C be the modular curve with lmfdb label 16.96.5.q.1
We compute the automorphism group over F3 and find there is one genus one quotient by an involution. It has 4 points.
The single rank one elliptic curve factor of the Jacobian has 8 points over F3.
NOT bielliptic.
