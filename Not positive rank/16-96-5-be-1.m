Here is a summary of the argument.

Let C be the modular curve with lmfdb label 16.96.5.be.1.
We compute the automorphism group over F5 and find there is one genus one quotient by an involution. It has 4 points.
The single rank one elliptic curve factor of the Jacobian has 8 points over F5.
NOT bielliptic.
