Here is a summary of the argument.

Let C be the modular curve with lmfdb label 16.96.5.bf.1.
We compute the automorphism group over F7 and find there is one genus one quotient by an involution. It has 8 points.
The single rank one elliptic curve factor of the Jacobian has 12 points over F7.
NOT bielliptic.
