/****************************************************************************** 
Here is a summary of the argument.

Let C be the modular curve with lmfdb label 32.96.5.n.2.
We find there are three genus one quotients by an involution. 
We are able to find a point on the second curve by intersecting with a hyperplane. From this, we are able to construct an elliptic curve, 
which we find to be rank 1.
