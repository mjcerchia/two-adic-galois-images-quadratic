Here is a summary of the argument.

Let C be the modular curve with lmfdb label 64.96.5.a.2
We find there are three genus one quotients by an involution. 
We are able to find a point on one of the curves by intersecting with a hyperplane. From this, we are able to construct an elliptic curve, 
which we find to have rank 1.
