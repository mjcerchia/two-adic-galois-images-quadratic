Here is code verifying the results of the manuscript ``"Modular Curves of Prime-Power Level with Infinitely Many Quadratic Points''``, by Michael Cerchia and Rakvi.

The folder Magma Code contains a file for each positive rank bielliptic modular curve where Magma is used. The file names correspond to the LMFDB labels.
