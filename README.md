This is a collection of code verifying the results of the manuscript ``"Modular Curves of Prime-Power Level with Infinitely Many Quadratic Points''``, by Michael Cerchia and Rakvi.

The folder ``Magma Code`` contains a file for each positive rank bielliptic modular curve where Magma is used in its argument. The file names correspond to the LMFDB labels. 

The folder ``Not positive rank`` contains a file for each candidate curve that is not hyperelliptic and fails to be positive rank bielliptic. In the argument summaries at the top of each file, we write "not bielliptic" as shorthand for "not positive rank bielliptic". 

In each folder, the files can be run in Magma as is, without any package installations.
